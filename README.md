“Anyone can revolutionize their lives once they revolutionize the direction in which they are moving. But, if you don’t even know where you are going, how will you ever know when you get there?”

Hello and Welcome to my Channel, My Name is Malcolm Xavier and today i will be talking about Why Setting Goals are Important, Why Do we need to Set Goals, and How can we Achieve them.and I have also included the Secret which has helped me Achieve my Goals till Date  and i am pretty sure that you will have few take aways from this video!

I would also want you to share your ideas about this Topic with me in the comment section !

Many people today are sleepwalking through life. Even though they work hard, they don’t feel like they are getting what they want. That’s because they don’t have a direction of where they want to go, what they want to achieve. Students graduate and they’re not sure what to do with their life; adults work for years and are shocked when they reach their 30s/40s and they don’t know what to do next.

we have recently seen how the pandamic has impacted so many of us in different ways !People lost jobs and some saw their businesses shuting down ! Now the Only Hope is the Vacine !

But i feel that the impact was not just financial but also mental, several people had issues battling out depression and anxiety and they had no choice but on the other hand there were some who took as an opportunity and spend time in creating opportunities for themselves for self-improvement, finding purpose and life happily

If you have a purpose or rather you are Goal Oriented person and you are focused on it, you will really not give any importance to external factors that are happening in your surrounding  and still find motivation and stay on course to achieve your Goals

I would like to share a story with you which talks about why goal setting is important !One man was searching for an answer to the question: “What is the power? “.He found out that there was a sage in his region. He came to this sage and saw that there was a nice house instead of poor shag and children were playing in the yard… A man was surprised; he thought that people who comprehended the truth, should live differently. He asked the owner to help him to find the answer.

A sage said:— You can find the strength in yourself. Seek for your way or follow the road of the ancestors…  I’ll tell you a storyOne man, looking for perfection, was training hard day after day. And he knew the power of body.Not bowing to the difficulties, he went ahead. Defeated himself. And he knew the power of spirit.

Comprehending the thoughts of great people, he found his opinion. And he knew the power of knowledge.He fell in love, bowed down to the earth goddess of his heart. And he knew the power of feelings.He had a house and a family. He took his child in the arms, and knew the power of life.Encountering the unknown with pacification, he did not regret about the past and knew the power of death.

Why have a Goal

Setting goals gives you long-term vision and short-term motivation . It focuses your acquisition of knowledge, and helps you to organize your time and your resources so that you can make the most of your life.

Setting goals helps trigger new behaviors, helps guides your focus and helps you sustain that momentum in life. Goals also help align your focus and promote a sense of self-mastery. In the end, you can't manage what you don't measure and you can't improve upon something that you don't properly manage.

Purpose

Goals are the targets toward which you point your life. Goals give you a starting point and a destination to reach.

Method 

Written goals help you to see where you are going, what changes you need to make and if you are progressing towards your prize.

Organization Goals

they provide guidance and direction; facilitate planning, motivate and inspire employees; and help organizations evaluate and control performance.

**GOAL-SETTING**

Writing down the goals you've set for yourself and planning the action steps to achieve these goals will create a positive pressure. Look at this as a way of challenging yourself. See how far you can get. Feel proud of the work, discipline and commitment. Here is a step-by-step plan on how to set meaningful goals:

**1. Create different sections for goals** relating to the different areas of your life (for example, self-development, fitness, health, spirituality, career, finances, relationships, etc.)

**2.** Write down **max 3 goals for each section.** Most importantly, set goals that have value and that matter to you. In order to do so, I suggest answering this question once you've written down your goal: “*Why do I want this*?” Anthony Robbins has a chapter in his book [Awaken the Giant Within](https://amazon.co.uk/dp/0743409388/?tag=lookjarcom-21) that encourages you to be honest with yourself and understand why you want these particular things. It all comes down to the fact that you want to achieve/be/do these things because it will help achieve certain emotions and feelings.

**3. Plan & write down action steps** that will help you achieve these things. You've probably heard the quote “*a goal without a plan is just a wish*”. This is exactly why I'm encouraging you to create logical order of the action steps you need to take in order to make your desires into achievable goals. Breaking down your big goals into smaller, measurable steps will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. This is a great system of making sure that you know where to start and to keep yourself accountable. Ticking off the things you've accomplished are sure to create a sense of achievement and motivation.

**4. Attach a timeline** to your goal. This will help direct your attention towards the most important goals. It's also important to stop, tap yourself on the shoulder and celebrate all the big and small wins.

**5. Track the progress.** Keep this piece of paper where you can see it every day and make sure to schedule the action steps in your agenda in order to meet the deadlines. It's time to review the action steps and ask yourself “What are the next steps I need to complete in order to achieve my goal?”. Review them weekly - feel the motivation and inspiration.

**6. Reward**

make sure the goals you set are aligned with the five SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound), you have an anchor on which to base all of your focus and decision-making.

you could have a Short Term Goal or a long Term Goal

### **The “Harvard Study”**There have been some questions as to whether a study done at Harvard University in 1979 is actually a valid study.

The Harvard MBA study, supposedly done in 1979 was thought to assess how written and planned for goals affected outcomes later in life. While some believe the study was real, others have intermingled the research with a supposed study done at Yale.

In the study, the students were asked, “*Have you set clear, written goals for your future and made plans to accomplish them?*”

Of those who were asked, only 3% of the graduates had written goals and plans. 13% of the students had goals, but those goals were not in writing.

84% of students polled had no specific goals at all.Ten years later the students were supposedly interviewed once again. The findings were astonishing. The 13% of those who had goals, but not written them down, were actually earning twice as much when compared to the 84% who had no goals at all.

The 3% who had written down goals were earning ten times the other 97% put together.If these results are indeed true, they are astonishing in the fact they clearly show that setting goals, even goals you don’t write down, make a big difference when it comes to success in life.

Research led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London has provided new insights into why people often make unrealistic plans that are doomed to fail.

The study, published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research, analysed the complex relationship between reward and effort in achieving goals, and identified two critical stages in the decision-making process.

The researchers found that when people first decide what to do they are motivated by rewards
